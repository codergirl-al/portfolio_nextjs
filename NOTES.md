#### This is a notes file. This means anything that is new to me (NextJS or TypeScript related) will be explained here in a theoretical and practical level.

## Next.JS



## Typescript
-> Superset of JavaScript which adds static typing.
-> Allows specifying the type of data being passed around
    -> Reports errors in case of types not matching
-> Uses compile time type checking, meaning the specified types will be checked if they match BEFORE running the code.
-> Compiler will transpile TS code into JS --> Runs anywhere where JS does
